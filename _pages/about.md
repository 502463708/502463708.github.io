I'm a third-year PhD student from [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/new/index.php), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html). My research interests include computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. YUAN Wu, Scott](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/prof_yuan_biography.pdf) of [ABI-Lab](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
