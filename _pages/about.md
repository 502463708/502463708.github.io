I'm a third-year PhD student from [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/new/index.php), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html). My research interests include AI for healthcare, intelligent ophthalmology, label-efficient learning, and real-world robustness. Currently, I am concentrating on multi-modal video understanding for ophthalmology surgeries, aiming to enhance surgical skills training, efficient surgical information management, and intraoperative decision-making.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. YUAN Wu, Scott](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/prof_yuan_biography.pdf) of [ABI-Lab](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/yuan/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before this, I completed my master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. CHEN Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=LxjxwpgAAAAJ) from [College of Software Engineering](https://ai.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). Furthermore, I also have industrial work experience at [United Imaging Intelligence](https://www.uii-ai.com/) and [MicroPort Group](https://www.microport.com.cn/).
