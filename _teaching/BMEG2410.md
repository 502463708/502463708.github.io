My responsibilities centered on instructing undergraduates in partial differential equations (PDEs). I elucidated key concepts, emphasizing their mathematical principles and relevance to engineering. I taught solution techniques for wave and heat equations, simplifying derivations under diverse conditions. Through discussions and problem-solving, students applied these methods to biomedical engineering scenarios, enhancing their PDE problem-solving skills.
