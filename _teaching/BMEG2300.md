In this role, I instructed undergraduate students on pivotal mathematical tools for engineering. I taught Laplace transforms, showing how they streamline transient and linear circuit analysis. For signal processing, I covered Fourier series and Fourier transforms, emphasizing their utility in biomedical signal analysis by transforming time-domain data to the frequency domain. Through hands-on tutorials, I helped students apply these concepts to practical engineering problems.
